# Increasing Representation of Women in Computational Biology

## Introduction

Women are generally underrepresented in
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) disciplines.
However, the degree of representation is not consistent across fields.
Biology and Computer Science (CS) are particularly discordant;
over half of biology PhD recipients are women,
while less than 20% of CS PhD recipients are [(Bonham and Stefan 2017)][1].
While the reasons for this disparity is unclear,
it may be possible to increase diversity in programming communities
through interdisciplinary fields such as computational biology.
To this end,
I plan to design an introductory computer science course
targeted at biology majors
and to measure the effect of this course on
self-reported interest and confidence in computing.

## (1) What is the proposed activity?

I recently started a position as a Research Scientist at Wellesley College,
a women’s liberal arts college in eastern Massachusetts.
I will design and teach an introductory programming course
that is designed specifically for biology majors
and uses biological problems to illustrate CS concepts
using julia as the primary language.
In addition,
I will survey students before and after the course
to assess their attitudes towards computational and quantitative activities.
I hypothesize that a course
that frames these activities in the context of something more familiar
(in this case biology),
will improve both interest and confidence in computer science.

After completing this course, students will be able to:

- Navigate their computer and manipulate files using a command line interface.
- Write a script to perform statistical analyses on and plot a large numerical dataset.
- Find, download, and process large biological sequence datasets from an online source
- Search for a solution to a novel error or software bug and implement it in their own code.
- Use a version control system to keep track of changes to their code.

A key component of the course will be
teaching students to be self-directed in their learning.
Specifically,
I will design lessons and assignments focused on how to search online for solutions
(eg. on stackoverflow)
and how to ask good questions on online forums such as julia discourse.
As part of this effort,
it would also be useful to engage the wider julia community
by alerting them to the potential influx of new questions,
and possibly by creating a slack channel specifically for students in the course.

I have extensive teaching experience,
having designed and taught courses for undergraduates, graduate students and adult learners.
I recently finished co-teaching an introductory programming course (using python)
at the Harvard School of Public Health for biostatistics students.

## (2) How will the proposed activity help make the Julia community more inclusive and ultimately more diverse?

Most directly, this course will increase diversity in the julia community
because all of the students will be women,
and open source communities are typically dominated by men ([Open Source Survey][2]; [Terrell et al. 2017][3]).
Students will be actively encouraged to engage with the wider julia community
to ask for help and to get feedback on their projects.

More generally,
I will design and conduct surveys of the students to assess
their attitudes towards course content,
including their online interactions.
These data will be made available to the wider julia community,
and will provide valuable insights into the inclusivity of our online spaces.
Finally, all course materials (including survey instruments)
will also be open sourced,
allowing others to replicate and improve upon these efforts.

## (3) Will you be able to measure the impact of your project? If so, how? If not, why?

Yes, the primary purpose of grant funds will be to enable this measurement.

In particular, I will assess:

- Computational and quantitative skills learned
  (through course assignments and a pre/post test)
- Subjective attitudes regarding interest and confidence in computational and quantitative skills
  (survey instrument conducted with pre/post test)
- Engagement in online communities
  (quantitative assessment of github, slack and discourse activity)

Though the number of students will be small in the first iteration of the course,
it may be possible to look for relationships between these three domains.
In particular,
it will be worth investigating whether increased online interaction
is negatively or positively correlated with students’ subjective assessment
of their own skills and interest in pursuing computational biology.

## (4) What funds/resources does your project require and why? If you were granted 50% of the funds you’ve requested, would you be able to use those funds to do impactful work?

|                           | Cost  | Count     | Subtotal | Notes          |
|---------------------------|-------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Teaching assistant salary | $1680 | 2         | $3360    | Semester Total |
| Additional student hours  | $12   | 30        | $360     | cost per hour  |
|                           |       | **Total** | $3720    |                |

I am requesting $3720
to pay the salaries of two student teaching assistants during the course run,
and 30 additional hours of student salary
to be split before and after the course
for assistance with curriculum development and data analysis respectively.
In the absence of grant funding,
I will still be able to design and teach the course,
which may still have a meaningful impact on diversity in the julia community.
However, it would be difficult to implement the additional research
into the effectiveness of teaching activities and impact on attitudes of students,
which, in turn,  will limit the usefulness of the effort for others.
With reduced funding to pay a single TA,
or reduced hours before and after the course run,
I will be able to implement a subset of research activities,
but may not be able to address all of the proposed activities.

## (5) Do you agree to provide a status update halfway through the grant period and a blog post at the end of the grant period?

Yes, I would be happy to report halfway through the grant period and at the end.
I also plan to solicit feedback on discourse about course materials,
and make all course material and research findings available on github.
