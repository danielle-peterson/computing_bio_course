If you&#39;ve ever looked at files on your <code>Desktop</code>, or opened <code>Finder</code>/<code>Explorer</code> and navigated to your <code>Documents</code> folder, you&#39;ve been using the file system. Data is stored on your hard drive as a continuous binary sequence (just <code>1</code>s and <code>0</code>s) and without a filesystem, it would be impossible to find anything!</p><p><code>Finder</code>/<code>Explorer</code> are software programs used to interact with your filesystem. The filesystem contains a mix of files, which are blobs of information (eg. a <code>.docx</code> file containing a MS Word doc) and folders, which can contain files as well as other folders. Just to be confusing, what we colloquially call folders are technically called &quot;directories.&quot; I will use the terms interchangeably.</p><p><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/macintosh-terminal-pocket/9781449328962/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1448104.png" alt="File system hierarchy"/></p><p>You may not have thought much about how the filesystem is organized, but you probably have an intuitive sense of how this works. Your <strong><a href="#footnote-home">[home]</a></strong> directory contains the <code>Desktop</code> and <code>Documents</code> directories, each of which might contain many other subdirectories and/or files, and each subdirectory may have yet more subdirectories and files and so on.</p><p><code>Finder</code>/<code>Explorer</code> are examples of a graphical user interface (GUI - pronounced &quot;gooey&quot;), that is a program that allows you to interact with it visually. However, GUIs are difficult to design and maintain, so most bioinformatics tools are built around <strong>[^command line]</strong> or text-based interfaces. The good news is that the organization of the filesystem is the same whether you&#39;re interacting with it in a GUI or in the terminal. And once you learn how to use the command line interface, you&#39;ll see that it is a powerful way to get a lot done quickly.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".1:-Open-the-terminal-application-1" href="#.1:-Open-the-terminal-application-1">1.1: Open the terminal application</a></h2><p><strong>Mac Users</strong>:  </p><ol><li>Open Applications</li><li>Click Open the <code>Terminal</code> application</li></ol><p><strong>Windows Users</strong>:  </p><ol><li>Click Start -&gt; Programs</li><li>Open Windows Subsystem for Linux</li></ol><p>You will be greeted with a white or black box that contains some text, and a cursor next to the dollar symbol <code>$</code>. This is the command prompt.</p><div class="admonition tip"><div class="admonition-title">Tip</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>Using the terminal can be quite challenging at first. For one, you cannot interact with text in the same way as you would in a word-processing program like Microsoft Word. In particular, you can&#39;t use your mouse to do things like click to move a cursor, or highlight a section of text to be deleted. Instead, you have to use ← and → keys.</p></div></div><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".2-Walk-around-your-file-system-1" href="#.2-Walk-around-your-file-system-1">1.2 Walk around your file system</a></h2><p>Think of your filesystem as a branching network of roads that you can walk along. Each directory is a location that has a path back to its parent directory, may or may not contain objects (files), and may have one or many roads leading to new locations (subdirectories).</p><p>Your present location, referred to as the <strong>[^working directory]</strong>, is your home folder when you first open the terminal. Let&#39;s see where that is.</p><p>In your terminal, type <code>pwd</code> and press enter. This is the &quot;print working directory&quot; command.</p><pre><code class="language-sh">$ pwd</code></pre><pre><code class="language-none">/home/kevin</code></pre><p>If you&#39;re using a Mac, this probably displayed something like <code>/Users/yourname</code>.</p><div class="admonition tip"><div class="admonition-title">Tip</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>Whenever you see code blocks in these lessons that start with <code>$</code>, this is a hint that it is a shell command. When copying or typing these commands, <strong>do not</strong> include the <code>$</code> (or anything to the left of it). For example, to complete the task above, you should only type <code>pwd</code>, then press enter.</p><p><code>$</code> is referred to as the &quot;prompt&quot; or &quot;command prompt.&quot; When you enter a command, you may or may not see some output (which will not be preceded by <code>$</code>) and once the command has finished executing, you will see a new prompt.</p><p>These code blocks will often be followed by a block that does <strong>not</strong> start with a <code>$</code>. This is the expected output.</p></div></div><p>Let&#39;s take a look around. the <code>ls</code> command is used to <code>l</code>i<code>s</code>t the contents of the directory.</p><pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls</code></pre><pre><code class="language-none">bin      Documents     R       scratch
Desktop  Downloads     Public  repos</code></pre><p>Your output will likely look a bit different from mine, but you&#39;ll probably see <code>Documents</code> and <code>Desktop</code>, as well as other directories you may recognize.</p><p>The <code>ls</code> command can also take a directory as an &quot;<a href="#footnote-argument">[argument]</a>.&quot; We&#39;ll talk more about what that means later - for now, just add <code>Desktop</code> to the command, separated by a space</p><pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls Desktop</code></pre><pre><code class="language-none">df.csv  dm.csv  dupes.csv  itp.svg</code></pre><p>Again, your output should look different from mine, but (assuming you store anything on your Desktop), you should see a list of files and directories. If your <code>Desktop</code> is pristine, congratulations! You won&#39;t see any output.</p><div class="admonition note"><div class="admonition-title">Windows Users</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>A reminder that this <code>Desktop</code> is your linux <code>Desktop</code>. To see your Windows Desktop, use <code>/mnt/c/Users/yourname/Desktop</code> instead.</p></div></div><p>The filesystem is organized hierarchically - At the very top of the hierarchy is the <strong><a href="#footnote-root">[root]</a></strong>, which you can think of as a folder that contains all other files and folders. On a Mac (and other Unix systems), the root is referred to with a single forward slash (<code>/</code>), While on Windows machines, the root is probably <code>C:\</code>.</p><div class="admonition note"><div class="admonition-title">Windows Users</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>When you open Windows Subsystem for Linux, you&#39;re actually running a fully functional OS with its own file system. As a result, when you type <code>pwd</code> in the terminal, you will see something like <code>/home/yourname</code>, rather than seeing your Windows OS home folder.</p><p>But WSL has access to your files in a special path, <code>/mnt/c/</code>. If you want to see the files in your Windows <code>Desktop/</code> directory for example, look in <code>/mnt/c/Users/yourname/Desktop</code>.</p></div></div><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Moving-around-1" href="#Moving-around-1">Moving around</a></h3><p>Say you are sitting in your room, and you want to give someone directions to <a href="https://w100.wellesley.edu/lulu">Lulu</a>. One way to do this would be to give directions from where you are:</p><ol><li>Go out the door,</li><li>Go down the hall to the elevator</li><li>... etc</li></ol><p>In this case, you&#39;re providing a [^relative path] - the directions only make sense if the person is starting in your room. If they&#39;re at the Science Center and they follow your instructions, they will become hopelessly lost.</p><p>Alternatively, you could provide directions from a shared point of reference.</p><ol><li>Start at the campus gate on the corner of Weston Rd and Central St</li><li>Walk down the path and turn right just past the Child Study Center towards the Botanical Gardens</li><li>... etc</li></ol><p>In this case, you&#39;re providing an [^absolute path] - no matter where the person is at the time, the directions will make sense.</p><p>An absolute path is great, since the same instructions are useful in most situations, but in many cases, it would be tedious to always have to start instructions from the same location.</p><p>When providing a file path to a unix operating system, you can also provide relative or absolute paths. There are two shared points of reference, your home folder and <code>root</code>, which are specified by <code>~/</code> and <code>/</code> respectively when placed at the beginning of the path.</p><p>Up above, when we looked at the contents of the Desktop using ls, we provided the <em>relative path</em> from where we were in the home folder. You can tell, because the path did not start with <code>~/</code> or <code>/</code>.</p><p>We could have done the same thing using an <em>absolute path</em>:</p><pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls ~/Desktop</code></pre><pre><code class="language-none">df.csv  dm.csv  dupes.csv  itp.svg</code></pre><p>The output here should be the same as what you got above. But what if we&#39;re in a different location?</p><p>In order to <code>c</code>hange the working <code>d</code>irectory, we use the <code>cd</code> command, giving a path as an argument. For example, to make <code>Desktop</code> the current working directory:</p><pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd ~/Desktop</code></pre><div class="admonition warning"><div class="admonition-title">Checking Question</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>Is <code>~/Desktop</code> a relative or absolute path?</p></div></div><p>It&#39;s a good idea (in general, but especially while learning) to repeatedly check that the thing you think happened actually happened.</p><pre><code class="language-sh">$ pwd</code></pre><pre><code class="language-none">/home/kevin/Desktop</code></pre><pre><code class="language-sh">$ ls</code></pre><pre><code class="language-none">df.csv  dm.csv  dupes.csv  itp.svg</code></pre><p>Notice that with <code>ls</code>, we didn&#39;t have to give <code>Desktop</code> as an argument this time. By default, <code>ls</code> lists files in the current working directory.</p><div class="admonition warning"><div class="admonition-title">Checking Questions</div><div class="admonition-text"><ol><li>What does <code>pwd</code> stand for?</li><li>What does <code>ls</code> stand for?</li><li>With <code>Desktop</code> as your working directory,  how would you list the contents of your home folder?</li></ol></div></div><p>Let&#39;s go back to the home folder. Again, we can provide a relative or an absolute path - the absolute path back to home is always <code>~/</code>, but how do we do the relative path? To walk into subdirectories, we can just provide the name of the subdirectory, but how do we walk &quot;backwards&quot;, into a parent directory?</p><p>In unix, parent directories are indicated with <code>../</code>. So to go back home from <code>/home/kevin/Desktop</code> using a relative path, I would write:</p><pre><code class="language-sh">$ cd ../
$ pwd</code></pre><pre><code class="language-none">/home/kevin</code></pre><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Practice-1" href="#Practice-1">Practice</a></h3><p>Practice moving around your file system using <code>cd</code>, and check where you are using <code>pwd</code> and <code>ls</code>. If you get lost, just enter <code>cd ~/</code> to get yourself home.</p><div class="admonition tip"><div class="admonition-title">Tip</div><div class="admonition-text"><p>Rather than typing long paths (or even short ones), use the <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> key to do auto-completion. For example, with your home folder as your current working directory, type <code>ls De</code> (don&#39;t execute), then press <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>. This should cause the terminal to fill in <code>ls Desktop</code> automatically.</p><p>Try typing <code>ls Do</code>, then <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>. The first time, nothing happens. Why? Because both <code>Documents</code> and <code>Downloads</code> are valid completions, and the terminal doesn&#39;t know which one you want. If you hit <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> again, it will display all of the options available. If you add a <code>c</code>, then hit <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>, it should complete <code>Documents</code>.</p><p>As you&#39;re navigating around, try to do as little typing as possible. Get into the habit of typing a little bit of a path, then hitting <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> (twice if nothing shows up the first time).</p></div></div><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".3-Manipulating-files-1" href="#.3-Manipulating-files-1">1.3 Manipulating files</a></h2><ul><li><code>mkdir</code>, <code>rmdir</code></li><li><code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>rm</code></li><li>globs</li></ul><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Key-Terms-1" href="#Key-Terms-1">Key Terms</a></h2><p>[^file system]: a hierarchical organization of files and folders. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">Additional reading</a> <a href="#footnote-root">[root]</a>: the top of the filesystem hierarchy.
